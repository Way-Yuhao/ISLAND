## TODO
- [x] Fix the TIF issue on Windows machines
- [ ] What is the temporal locality of labels?
- [ ] What algorithm did USGS use to compute surface reflectance?
- [ ] Plot NDVI change over time
- [ ] Plot NVID/PV value for concrete and bare soil
- [x] Plot ASTER GED over time
- [ ] Incorporate LANDSAT 9 to improve temporal continuity
